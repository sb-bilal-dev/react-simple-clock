Check it out [here](https://react-simple-clock.vercel.app/) live.

I like maditating to the sound of the clock while looking at it for a long period (20-60 minutes). I don't know whether this kind of meditation is practicied by others, it just came to me naturally, if you know it I'll be happy to know it too :).
